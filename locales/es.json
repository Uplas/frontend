  "faq1_question": "ES: Will AI take my job?",
  "faq1_answer": "ES: It's a valid concern! While AI automates some tasks, it primarily *changes* jobs, creating new roles and demanding new skills. AI excels at processing data, but lacks human creativity, critical thinking, and empathy. The key isn't fearing replacement, but learning to collaborate with AI – letting it handle the repetitive work so you can focus on higher-value tasks. Uplas teaches you how.",
  "faq2_question": "ES: Why do I need to learn AI?",
  "faq2_answer": "ES: AI is becoming fundamental across industries – from healthcare and finance to marketing and education. Understanding AI helps you leverage powerful tools to boost productivity, gain deeper insights from data, make better decisions, and ultimately become more valuable in your role. Staying current with AI is becoming essential for career growth and security.",
